## Lovelace GUI Setup

## Manual Install

Both JS files need to be stored inside the path/to/config/www/ folder. In the Lovelace reource URL path, local is the same as the www folder. Construct your path to the JS inside the www folder for the resurce URL. For the example below:

```
path/to/config/www/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card.js

path/to/config/www/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card-editor.js
```

Configuration > Lovelace Dashboards > Resources

```
url: /local/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card.js
type: Javascript Module
```

## HACS Install

[HACS](https://hacs.xyz) will install the files and add an entry in the Lovelace resource

- Have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) installed in your instance of HASS
- Add URL: **https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card** as a custom repository with Type: **LOVELACE**
- Navigate to the Frontend directory
- Search for Mail and Packages, then choose install
- You may need to empty your browser cache for the frontend to recognize the new files.

HACS install path

```
/path/to/config/www/community/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/
```

Path HACS adds to Lovelace resources

```
/hacsfiles/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages-Custom-Card.js
```

## Card Configuration

Add a manual card then input the yaml below.

```
type: 'custom:mail-and-packages-card'
name: Mail Summary
updated: sensor.mail_updated
details: true
image: false
```

Switch to the visual editor and complete the setup by assigning the sensors you have enabled in the [Mail and Packages integration](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages).

#### USPS Mail Image Display

The mail images can be displayed by using the mail_today.gif directly or use a [local file camera entity](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Example-Automations-and-Templates#camera). Use the blue toggle switches to turn either option on or off.

- Mail GIF Location: The mail_today.gif file must be saved in the `www` folder for the front end to load it. If the image is saved directly in the `www` folder you will use the path `/local/mail_today.gif`. Please see the [Mail and Packages Integration](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Configuration-and-Email-Settings#configuration) configuration section for the path the integration should be set to based on the type of HASS installation you are using. Random image file name setting should be turned off.

- Camera Entity: Set up a [local file camera entity](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/local_file/) described in the [integrations WIKI](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Example-Automations-and-Templates#camera). Set this option to the name of the local file camera entity you created.

#### Delivery Message Sensor

The delivery message sensor, `sensor.mail_delieveries`, is not created by the [Mail and Packages Integration](https://github.com/moralmunky/Home-Assistant-Mail-And-Packages/wiki/Example-Automations-and-Templates#post-0115). You must create a [template sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/). This is left out of the integration on purpose so they can customize as they see fit.
